# Ecoacoustic bank
Ecoacoustic bank is a software for managing and storing passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data, specializing in tropical forest species such as anurans, insects, and birds, but not exclusively to these. The software allows integrating audio with other commonly collected data types, such as information on acquisition systems used and spatial-temporal conditions. For information regarding its installation and use visit wiki [here](https://github.com/Bioacustica/Ecoacustic_bank/wiki), additional information can be found in the article [here](https://github.com/Bioacustica/Ecoacustic_bank/wiki).
